A backpack using fine-tuned vibrations to allow those who cannot hear sound to feel it through their body instead. This integrated signal processing to separate the low, mid, and high frequencies sound creates. These frequencies are then sent to bass shakers throughout the backpack to accurately deliver sound to the body via vibrations. Also, with my background in music, the feelings that the backpack delivers will be extremely accurate to any user.
