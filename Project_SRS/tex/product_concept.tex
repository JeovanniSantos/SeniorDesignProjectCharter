This section describes the purpose, use and intended user audience for the sound backpack product. The sound backpack is a system that takes in musical sound waves and outputs them as vibrations. The sound backpack will allow users with hearing disabilities to enjoy music by allowing them to fill the sound waves of songs.

\subsection{Purpose and Use}
The sound backpack will take in a song, filter the low, mid, and high frequencies, then pass those frequencies to different shakers inside the backpack. The shakers will emit a vibration in time with the music so users can feel the beat.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
The sound backpack will be available for purchase by the general public, but it will be designed and targeted for customers with hearing disabilities. Age restrictions may apply after evaluating the complexity of the final product.
