The Lab room in the Engineering Research building will be needed to work on the functional part of the vest, which comprises of the raspberry pi, and the additional components needed for the vest. Other work areas like the Fab lab might be used to work on the making the vest itself. Currently the complete list of equipment needed have not been completely decided on, but we will be using a raspberry pi, and the materials which will be used to make the vest. There is not necessarily any space for the demo, as it would be worn by an individual, so the classroom where the demo will take place is sufficient. To make to vest, there is a possibility that the services of the Theater students will be needed.
