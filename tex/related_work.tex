Discuss the state-of-the-art with respect to your product. What solutions currently exist, and in what form (academic research, enthusiast prototype, commercially available, etc)? Include references and citations as necessary \cite{Rubin2012}. If there are existing solutions, why won't they work for your customer (too expensive, not fast enough, not reliable enough, etc.). This section should occupy 1/2 - 1 full page, and should include at least 5 references to related work.
