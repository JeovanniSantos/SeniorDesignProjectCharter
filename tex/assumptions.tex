\begin{itemize}
  \item The vest can be tested anywhere as it has to be worn by an individual to be useful
  \item The raspberry pi would be put at the bottom of the vest which will be padded in the event that it heats up 
  \item The vest will be made of a light material in order not to be too heavy for the user
  \item There will be a website which will serve as a user interface in order to interact with the vest. There would also be dials on the vest that the user can use to change the sound volume.
  \item The vest will be able to play music from Spotify 
  \item The vest could probably be wireless (*not sure about this)
