The construction of the hardware of the system will be handled by Sochima Omenkeukwu and Jeovanni Santos. They will also be handling materials acquisition for this hardware. Ugo [last name] will be writing the software to translate audio into haptic signals to be sent to the motors in the vest.

There will likely be overlap from team members in terms of who is working on what, but overall, the team members as assigned above will be held liable for the operation of their respective component, and these assignments are expected to stay relatively constant throughout the development of the system.
