Product will be a backpack, custom made, from a light weight material. The backpack will be one size fits all, with adjustable straps for comfort. Several haptic motor controllers will be strategically sewn into the chest of the backpack, along with a micro-controller and button control panel. The motors will vibrate within the backpack according to the tempo of music played by the user. The music will be supplied and transmitted to the backpack through Spotify API calls. The user will be able to log into the backpack’s web based application to select music to play through the backpack. The music will play in audio through the device accessing the web app, as well as vibrate through the backpack. Profile settings and advanced backpack settings can be set in the backpack’s web application. The button controls on the backpack will allow the customer to make local changes to the function of the backpack, like vibration intensity. The backpack will receive sound waves and instructions for the motors from a raspberry pi micro controller. The micro-controller will filter through sound waves and send instruction to the motors.
