Product will be a vest, custom made, from a light weight material. The vest will be one size fits all, with adjustable straps for comfort. Several haptic motor controllers will be strategically sewn into the chest of the vest, along with a micro-controller and button control panel. The motors will vibrate within the vest according to the tempo of music played by the user. The music will be supplied and transmitted to the vest through Spotify API calls. The user will be able to log into the vest’s web based application to select music to play through the vest. The music will play in audio through the device accessing the web app, as well as vibrate through the vest. Profile settings and advanced vest settings can be set in the vest’s web application. The button controls on the vest will allow the customer to make local changes to the function of the vest, like vibration intensity. The vest will receive sound waves and instructions for the motors from a raspberry pi micro controller. The micro-controller will filter through sound waves and send instruction to the motors.
